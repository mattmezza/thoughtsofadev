# Organization

There is not just one way for a company to organize itself. A Service strategy is the implicit blueprint of the design, the size and the scope of an organization.

Organizations characterize themselves by the dominant management style in which the style corresponds with what the organization needs at a specifica moment in time.

*ITIL* describes five recognizable phases in organizational development along the spectrum of centralization and decentralization.

## Phase 1: Network
In Phase 1, an organization focuses on fast, informal and *ad hoc* provision of services. The organization is technologically oriented and is uncomfortable with formal structures. For organizations in stage 1 innovation and entrepeneurship are important organizational values. When the demand for sorvice increases, this model is no longer effective.

Advantages of this model are:

- avoid high burocratic costs;
- fewer managers are necessary;
- the structure is very flexible.

Disadvantages, instead, are:

- managers must oversee the integration of activities;
- significant coordination problems;
opportunities for outsourcing functional activities.


Advice: a change in leadership style is necessary to grow beyond these chalenges.

## Phase 2: Directive
The Pase 1 crisis can be resolved with a strong management team. Phase 2 focuses on the establishment of hierarchical structures (line management) that differentiate functional activities. Communication is more formal and varioous basic processes are used.

Advice: to grow beyond this challenge, more delegation is necessary.

## Phase 3: Delegation
A decentralized organizational structure is adopted in which the responsibility shifts from functional ownership (line management) to process ownership. Functional ownership and process ownership do not coincide.

Advice: imporove the co-ordination whithin the organization by initiating formal systems and programs.

## Phase 4: Co-ordination
In Phase 4 the focus is directed towards the use of formal systems as a means of chieving better co-ordination. Centralization of technical functions and decentralization of service management processes emerge, with the goal of improving response time to market demands.

Advice: if everything is in order internally, the next order of business is to improve co-operation with the customer.

## Phase 5: Collaboration
During Phase 5 the focus is on the improvemnt with the business. A commonly used structure is the matrix structure with the flow of functional responsibilities (line management) on the vertical line and the flow of product or customer-related responsibilities on the horizontal line.

Advantages of a matrix structure:

- minimizes and overcomes functional barriers;
- increases speed of response to changing product or customer needs;
- opening up communication among functional specialists;
- use of the skills of specialists staff who can move from prduct to product and from customer to customer.

Disadvantages of a matrix structure:

- lack of a monitoring structure;
- conflicting roles can demoralize staff;
- possible conflict situation between functions and product or customer needs.


Outsourcing structures
===
Can be divided into three types:

- **Internal outsourcing**:
  - *Type 1 Internal*: provision and delivery of internal stuff, limited in scale;
  - *Type 2 Shared Services*: working with internal BUs, offers lower costs than Type 1 but still limited in scale;
- **Traditional outsourcing**: Complete outsourcing of a service, better in terms of scaling but limited in best-in-class capabilities;
- **Multi-vendor outsourcing**:
  - *Prime*: single contract with one service provider who works with multiple service providers;
    - *Consortium*: selection of multiple service providers;
    - *Selective outsourcing*: pool of service providers selected and managed through the service receiver. The most difficult structure to manage;
    - *Co-Sourcing*: structure of internal or shared services with external providers. The service receiver is also the service integrator.



## Roles and responsibilities
A key role in the implementation of a sourcing strategy lies with the Chief Sourcing Officer, who reports to the CIO and manages the implementation of sourcing.

- **Director of service management**: supervises the provider on behalf of the business;
- **Contract manager**: manages the service contract;
- **Product manager**: manages the services in the service provider's organization;
- **Process owner**: manages the process models that have been developed on behalf of the users;
- **Business representives**: represent the customers' interests.


Tools for the Service Strategy
===
Some helpful tools to better achieve a good service strategy are the **Simulation** and the **Analytical modeling**. The first is a tool to evaluate the consequences of new policies and new structures before they are put into practice. The second is a way to benefit from the knowledge that comes from analytical modeling to improve performance in light of technical, financial and time constraints. Some of these tools are:

- **Business case**: a way of identifying business objectives that are dependento on service management;
> A **business case** is a decision-making, support and planning instrument that plans for the likely consequences of a business action.

- **Pre-program ROI**: techniques for quantitatively analyzing investments in service management;
Usage of NPV (Net Present Value) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) to assess the cash flows.
> "You have to **spend money** to **make money**..."

- **Post-program ROI**: techniques for retroactively analyzing investments in service management.

Quality perspective
===
The quality of services, such as that experienced by customers, is based on the **utility** and **warranty** that are provided. The many definitions of quality can be summarized in four broad perspectives:

- level of excellence;
- price-quality relationship;
- conformity to specifications;
- meeting or exceeding expectations.

## Warranty factors
Some factors are visible and measurable (tangible factors) others are much more difficult to pin down (intangible factors).
### Reliability
A factory, such as **MTBF** (*Mean Time Between Failures*), is difficult to calculate. MTBF records the reliability of a service asset: the higher the MTBF, the higher the reliability.

### Maintainability
*The Mean Time to Restore Service* **MTRS** is the recovery time within which a function (service, or system component) is operational again after a breakdown.

### Redundancy
*ITIL* defines four redundancy types that can be used individually or in combination: Active and Passive redundancy, and Diverse and Homogeneous redundancy.

Risks
===
*ITIL* defines risk as follows:
> **Risk** is an uncertain outcome, or in other words, a positive opportunity or a negative threat.

The task of tisk management is to ensure that the organization makes use, in a cost-effective manner, of a risk framework that consists of a set of well-defined steps.

There are two phases:
- **Risk analysis**: the gathering of information regarding the exposure to risks;
- **Risk management**: processes are put in place and these processes are focused on monitoring risks.

#### Transfer of risks
Services reduce the risk to the clinet's business but they bring risks to the service providers. Clients compensate the service providers for these risk in a variety of ways: first and foremost by paying for the services.

Some providers must ensure that sufficient compensation occurs but at the same time, they must remain reasonable.
> "Costs are facts but prices are a matter of policy"

That means that certain investments can yield a profit over th course of time.

#### Risk for the service provider
*ITIL* recognizes four types of risks:

- **Contract risks**: risks that the service provider will make it impossible to satisfy the contractual agreements;
- **Design risks**: there is always a risk that the services will achieve undesidered results, this is a performance risk;
- **Operational risks**: every organization deals with operational risks, risks for the BUs and risks for the service units;
- **Market risks**: these risks can be reduced with:
  - *Differentiation*: assets that are scarce and complementary are interesting;
    - *Consolidation*: reduces the financial risks for service providers as well as the operational risks for the customer.
