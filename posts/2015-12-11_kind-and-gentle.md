It has been a long time since I wrote my last article, I was trying to find the reasons why I didn't write but I guess it has been just because I like to occupy my spare time with plenty of projects to manage and ideas to realize. I don't know why I keep doing it. Probably, I just use to get exited too often. I mean, I love software and I love coding but what I like the most is building fantastic software products and enjoying the time in which I am developing it. I guess that this is mostly due to all my friends with whom I work because they basically think  just like me. We love coding, we love designing and we love staying together learning new development techniques. I'm almost turning 27 and with time it comes also maturity and maybe it is because of this that today I can affirm that the kind of Developers I like is just like this: a learner, a worker, kind and gentle and willing to help himself and the others to improve themselves.

I've been very lucky because I have had the opportunity to meet a lot of these Devs. With each of them I have built and learnt something and I hope they have learned something back from me.

But life is hard, we all know this. If you belong to the category I just described I want to warn you that we are a few, very rare indeed. Thus, my dear kind and gentle Dev, be very careful cause you'll encounter so many collegues of yours who simply don't think and act like you do. I made my skin very hard cause I have met a lot of them too. But let me be methodical... It's not a matter of if you'll meet one of these bad guys, it's a matter of when, unluckily. 

Throughout your path you will encounter these categories of Devs:

1. **the "let us arm ourselves & you leave"**
   - this kind of Devs is the least bad. Guys from this group cannot help you with your project except from helping you to order pizza or paying bills. Sometimes they can also be supportive and give ideas without participating actively and this is good. But c'mon, we want coders not consultants so be able to recognize this kind of Devs and just act accordingly depending on the situation.
1. **the "roast smoke"**
   - they are known to be sort of a dickhead, everybody thinks it but, since you are kind and gentle, you decide to give them a chance. They know how to move among software and technologies and they are good strategists and very good communicators. My advice is to set a limit to yourself: give one of them just 1 fucking chance, if he is not worth it, piss him off as he'll be useless and he will cause you only troubles (they developed their ability to shoot bullshit about tech and stuff because they are indeed ignorant).
1. **the "I could have made it better"**
   - you can recognize this type of Devs from their words when collaborating with you. They always want to have the last word and they always want to correct other Devs. No matter how huge and perfect your system is, they could have done it better! You can recognize this kind of Devs also from the amount and quantity of projects they have realized during their lives which, if I am correct, should be close to the fucking 0.
1. **the "I love what you do but I don't use it"**
   - these guys are awesome! They love your app, and they express their feelings in a very direct way that even the most malignant of us couldn't think that they are lying. But c'mon my friend, nobody loves anything if they don't fucking use it. It's a law. They are hypocritical and soul-destroying, to be avoided like the death.
1. **the "Nobody gives a fuck about you and your projects"**
   - be careful to this kind of Devs because they will be trying to steal from you whatever you could implicitly teach them. These Devs are probably the most arrogant ones. They just want to push you down to pull themselves up and you must not permit this. If you can, stop having to do with guys of this category as they are useless.

Perhaps, I didn't meet every kind of Devs during my life so I beg you to complete my list if you know some different ones.

Always remember this: *we are kind and gentle but we are not stupid*, we like to help friends and we appreciate being helped to improve our skills. 

You have to choose very well your company cause great things are made by great people! We are kind and gentle but sometimes we need to stand up and beat the shit out of some motherfuckers who just want to consume our precious time trying to steal knowledge from us.
