# Why IT Service Management?

Development in IT have had a tremendous effect on the business market during the last decades. We got from the Industrial age to the Information age! Most companies, nowadays, switched from a traditional hierarchical organization towards a process-oriented organization and project-oriented IT organization. With this configuration, processes must be organized to support a customer-oriented approach: there's the need for a Business-IT alignment!

The quality of information services in companies is being increasingly subjected to stricter **internal and external requirements** because there is a fast growing dependency of business upon information. In this scenario, **standards** and **frameworks** of *best practices* play a primary role.

The organizations need to be in full control of their processes.

# IT Governance

With the growing role of information, Information Systems and IT Service Management, the management requirements for IT grew as well. These requirements focus on two aspects:

* the compliance with internal and external policies, laws and regulations;
* the provision of added value to the stakeholders of the organization.

> "**IT Governance** consists of a comprehensive framework of structures, processes and relational mechanisms. **Structures** involve the existence of responsible functions such as *IT executives and accounts*, and a diversity of *IT committees*. **Processes** refer to strategic IT decision-making and monitoring. **Relational mechanisms** include business/IT participation and partnerships, strategic dialogue and shared learning."<sup>1</sup>

However, there is a substantial difference between IT Governance and IT Management: Governance enables the creation of a setting in which others can manage their tasks effectively. <sup>2</sup>

There are two main frameworks for IT Governance developed by different institutes:

* **ITIL** (*Information Technology Infrastructure Library)* which is a set of guidance developed by the Unitet Kingdom's Office of Government Commerce (OGC) sinve 1987;
* **COBIT** (*Control Objectives for Information and related Technology)* which is a set of best practices developed by ISACA (*Information Systems Audit and Control Association*), and ITGI (*IT Governance Institute*).

Although many frameworks are characterized as 'IT Governance frameworks', such as **COBIT** and even **ITIL**, most of them are in fact management frameworks.

There are also two main standards of reference:

* **BS 15000** by the British Standard Institute;
* **ISO-IEC 20000** by the Internation Standard Organization.

**IT must be aligned with Business.** IT has to support Business development and the only way to achive this objective is to align IT to the strategic views of the Business.

It is also important to assess the maturity of an organization in order to establish a proper communication. There is the need to assess the maturity of the service provider but also the maturity of the client. If there are large differences in maturity between the provider and the customer, then these will have to be considered to prevent a mismatch in the approach, methods and mutual expectations. Specifically, this affects the communication between the customer and the provider. There is the need to establish an horizontal communication.

The maturity is usually assessed through stepwise improvement models. These models are inspired by Nolan's staged model of the growth of IT in a Business organization <sup>3</sup>.
Briefly, Nolan's model is composed of six levels:

1. **Initiation:** when IT is instroduced for the first time into an organization;
2. **Contagion:** when there is a proliferation of applications and the usage of computers into the organization grows rapidly;
3. **Control:** when there is no reduction of the usage of the computers but a central control rise up to manage the initial chaos;
4. **Integration:** when all the different systems are integrated together into an unique company system;
5. **Data administration:** when data administration is introduced in order to get the most from the huge amount of data generated from all the IT system of the organization;
6. **Maturity:** when systems reflect the real information needs of the organization.

Inspired by this model, *SEI* (Software Engineering Institute) of *Carnegie Mellon University*, USA, published its **Software Capability Maturity Model** (SW-CMM). This was updated into newer versions including **CMMI** (*Capability Maturity Model Integrated*).

The **CMMI staged representation** model defines five maturity levels:

1. **Initial:** processes are ad hoc and chaotic. You can say what goes into as input but you cannot say what comes out as output. **Essentially uncontrolled.**
2. **Managed or Repeatable:** the projects of the organization have ensured that processes are planned and executed in accordance with policy. **Product management procedures defined and used.**
3. **Defined process:** processes are well characterized and understood, and are described into standards, procedures, tools and methods. **Process management procedures are defined and used.**
4. **Quantitatively managed:** the organization and projects establish quantitative objectives for quality and process performance, and use them as criteria in managing processes. **Quality management strategies are defined and used.**
5. **Optimizing:** focuses on continually improving process performance through incremental and innovative process and technological improvements. **Process improvement strategies are defined and used.**


# Service and Service Management

A **service** is a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes the customers want to achieve without the ownership of specific costs or risks.

**Service management** is a set of specialized organizational capabilities for providing value to customers in the form of services.

## Some definitions...

### Value
**Value** is the core of the service concept and from customer's perspective is composed by two aspects:

- **Utility:** what the customer receives;
- **Warranty:** how it is provided.

### System

A **system** is a group of interacting, interrelating, or interdependent components that form a unified whole, operating together for a common puropose.

### Function
A **function** is a subdivision of an organization that is specialized in fulfilling a specified type of work and is responsible for specific end results. Functions have their own knowledge body and their own practices.
### Process
A **process** is a structured set of activities designed to accomplish a defined objective. Characteristics of processes are:

- they are **measurable**;
- they have **specific results**;
- they provide results to **customers** or stakeholders;
- they **respond to a specific event**.

> "Is it a function or a process?"

â€“ It depends on the organizational design. A good example of a function is a service desk, a good example of a process is change management.

# Service lifecycle
ITIL associates processes to the different phases of the service lifecycle.

Each phase of the lifecycle is composed by some specific processes as follows.

Continual Service Improvement follows the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle.
