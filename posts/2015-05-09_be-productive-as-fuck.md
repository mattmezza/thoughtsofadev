Today I wanna write a little about my idea of productivity and of what I usually do in order to deliver more and better in less time.

The advices I'm going to give are the results of some years of attempts trying to get better and better in delivering high quality products.

![a funny comic](/public/content/comic.jpg)

### First thing first: the environment

Yeah. This could just sound useless to you but, believe me, your work environment is the first thing that helps you to achieve more. A good ambient light and a not too noisy place are the first step towards productivity. I'm not into writing shit that you can find onto every decent specialized website or things that you can ask to your mother.

### Second step: the monitor

Wanna reach the maximum? You've got to get a minimum 23 inches IPS monitor: your eyes will thank you and you will thank yourself for being able to work more.

Just to say: my monitor is an AOC IPS 23 inches i2369Vm *(man, I love this monitor)*.

### Third step: get the fucking keyboard and mouse

Whether you've got a brand new MacBook Pro with Force Touch or the new Dell XPS with its fantastic and beautiful keyboard you'd better get a standard keyboard and a mouse cause your wrists and hands need them. Dude, no more missing ; if your digits could type as fast as the one of this Indian guy.

### Fourth step: rest your eyes

You don't want to ship poor quality products. That's why I recommend you to rest your eyes from time to time.

Not so much time ago I stumbled upon a theory called 20-20-20 ([see more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision_syndrome#Therapy)) and I found it quite good. It's pretty simple: every 20 minutes stop watching your goddam monitor and stare something far enough (about 20 feet) for 20 seconds. I don't know why but this shit works. Plus, while resting your eyes, you've got the time to [take a step back](https://medium.com/conquering-corporate-america/10-tricks-to-appear-smart-during-meetings-27b489a39d1a#5d61) and redesign, rethink, refactor, *take the shit you've done and send it directly to hell without even touching the recycler*.

Me and a bunch of friends have made a desktop app just to remeber us when it's time to take a rest (cause when a computer tells you to do something you cannot hesitate in doing that). you can find it on Github, we called it [Eyesleep](https://github.com/intersimone999/eyesleep/releases/tag/v1.0) and that was our most creative name.

### Fifth advice: you communicate!

If there is a thing I hate when I'm working at my computer is when my mobile rings for a chat message. Most of the time I simply ignore the messages and read them from time to time (usually when I accumulate a bunch of them â€“ just to have the motivation to avoid reading them).

The rest of the times, the messages come from my girlfriend. In that case I've got a short amount of time to reply her or otherwise the number of messages grows exponentially with the passing of time.
More important to note, when I collaborate with colleagues or friends, I use to chat a lot and to share screenshots or other media. This cannot be done using a smartphone.

So for the 5th step I suggest you to start using a multi-platform messenger. The one I prefer and use is [Telegram](https://telegram.org). It has a beautiful design, a clear and intuitive UI *(even your girlfriend will start using it when you'll get her to know how many beautiful stickers Telegram has)*. Plus it has <a id="hashTags" href="#hashTags">#hashTags</a> to organize messages, @username to tag participants into group chats, quoting replies to avoid misunderstandings and super-duper-fast and efficient media sharing.

### Last thing: your editor

It's kinda hard to establish what is the best editor in this world. I mean, we've got plenty of tools out there in the Internet but, hey, do we need to use forever only one of them? The answer is [this](http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/nooo.mp3).

Personally I prefer to use integrated development environments for complex projects and lighter editors for smaller projects. Since I love Eclipse as IDE, I do not use to make web stuff with IDEs. I do web stuff with editors like Sublime Text 2 or Atom. Sometimes, when working remotely on my servers, I also use the very old vi but it gets kinda complicated when I want to refactor a python script to change a variable name (`:%s/search_string/replacement_string/g`). In these cases I've got to KISS (*Keep It Simple, Stupid*) my code.

### Very last thing: you are not alone

There is a plethora of Devs just like you who is facing the same exact problem you're trying to solve. There is a good probability that someone form China, India, Finland <span style="font-size: smaller">or I don't know anywhere else <span style="font-size:smaller;">but this is not the point <span style="font-size:smaller;">lemme finish the sentence</span></span></span> has already given a solution to your goddam problem.

So why don't you stop hurting yourself and take a nap instead of reinvent the wheel by developing a brand new Database Adapter.

##### Appendix to the very last thing

When you find the perfect library that solves your problem don't trust too much on it. Failures happen, and when you haven't got the sources cause they did not ship with the library, the only thing that is left up to you is to try to figure out who's the creator and then fuck his mother.

To avoid such pain in the ass, I usually give a look to how many stars the library project has on Github. It won't be an academic metric discussed during the [next ICSE](http://2015.icse-conferences.org) conference but it is often quite accurate.

Have you got more productive? Let me know whether or not these advices helped you, and reach me [here](mailto:mattmezza@gmail.com) if you would like to give me some suggestions I didn't take into account.

Now it's getting kinda late in the night while I'm writing this post and I'm sick of these 20 secs micro naps. I think I'm gonna sleep otherwise tomorrow I won't be **PaF**.
