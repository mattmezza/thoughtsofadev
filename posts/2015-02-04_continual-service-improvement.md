Nowadays IT departments must continually improve their services in order to remain appealing to the business. ITIL version 3 places this within the lifecycle phase of **Continual Service Improvement**.

In English there is a difference between *continual* and *continuous*:

- *continuous* means that the organization is involved in an activity without interruption;
- *continual* means a succession of closely placed activities, a sequence of improvement efforts, *continual improvements*.

CSI focuses o the activities and processes to improve the quality of services. It uses the *Plan-Do-Check-Act* Cycle of Deming (PDCA). This cycle prescribes a consolidation phase for each improvement. This is the reason why, in ITIL v3, the 'C' of CSI stands for *continual* instead of *continuous*.

# Goals

CSI mainly measures and monitors the following matters:

- **Process compliance**: Does the organization follow the new service management and does it use the new tools?
- **Quality**: Do the various activities meet their goals?
- **Performance**: How efficient is the process?
- **Business value of a process**: Does the process make a difference?

The goals of CSI are:

- to measure and analyze **Service Level Achievement** by comparing with the Service Level Agreements;
- to recommend improvements in all phases of the lifecycle;
- to introduce activities which will increase the quality, efficiency, effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

# CSI and organizational change

A lot of CSI programs fail because they do not (or cannot) achieve a cultural change of the organization.

## Kotter's 8-steps change model<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup>

John P. Kotter, Professor of Leadership at the Harvard Business School, examined over a hundred companies and discovered eight crucial steps needed to successfully change an organization:

1. **Create a sense of urgency**: identify potential threats and scenarios and examine opportunities, answer the question 'what if we do nothing?';
2. **Form a leading coalition**: identify real leaders and key stakeholders and work on the team;
3. **Create a vision**: determine the values for the change and create a strategy to execute the vision. Provide direction, motivate and formulate goals which are SMART (*Specific*, *Measurable*, *Achievable/Appropriate*, *Realistic/Relevant* and *Timely/Time-bound*);
4. **Communicate the vision**: lead by example and address people concerns and anxieties openly and honestly. Each stakeholder must know what the vision is;
5. **Empower others to act on the vision**: remove obstacles, recognize and reward people for making change happen, act proactively to remove barriers;
6. **Plan for and create quick wins**: look for sure-fire projects to implement, motivate the team;
7. **Consolidate improvements and create more change**: do what went wrong/well analysis, set goals and keep ideas fresh but, for first, don't declare victory too early;
8. **Institutionalize the changes**: talk about progresses, be positive and always praise in public and scorn in private.

Combined with good project management, these steps will considerably increase the chanches of success.


# The P-D-C-A Cycle

A big bang approach doesn't usually result in a successful improvement program. That's why Dr. W Edwards Deming developed a ste-by-step improvement model:

- **Plan**: what needs to happen;
- **Do**: execute planned activities;
- **Check**: whether the activities yield the desired result;
- **Act**: adjust the plan in accordance to the checks.

Next is a consolidation phase to engrain the changes into the organization.

# Metrics, KPIs and CSFs

A metric measures the results of a process or activity by determining whether a certain variable meets its set target. Three types are needed by CSI:

- **technology metrics**: measure the performance of components and applications;
- **process metrics**: measure the performance of service management processes. They stem from **Key Performance Indicators** which, in turn, stem from **Critical Success Factors**;
- **service metrics**: the results of the end service.

For the business mission, **CSFs** are defined: these are elements essential to achieving the mission. The **KPIs** following on from these CSFs determine the quality, performance, value and process compliance. They can either be qualitative (such as customer satisfaction) or quantitative (such as costs of a printer incident).

At the start of th improvement program two or three KPIs per CSF will already supply a great deal of information which will need to be processed.

# Data, information, knowledge and wisdom

Metrics supply **quantitative data**, CSI transforms this data into **qualitative information**. By combining information with experience, context, interpretation and reflection it becomes **knowledge**. What it comes down to in CSI is **wisdom**: being able to make the correct assessments and the correct decisions by using the data, information and knowledge in the best possible way.

# Governance

Governance drives organizations and can be distinguished into three types: **Corporate Governance**, **Business Governance** and **IT Governance**. Each of them belong to the **Enterprise Governance**.
**IT Governance** shapes the processes and structure of an IT organization and ensures that it achieves its goals.

# Processes

The organization must continually assess its current improvement course on relevance, completeness and feasibility. The CSI model can provide some support. This continual cycle consists of six phases:

1. determine the vision: formulates a mission, goals and objectives;
2. record the current situation: record the starting point;
3. determine measurable targets: set priorities together with the client;
4. plan: draw up a detailed service improvement plan;
5. check: measure whether the objectives have been achieved;
6. assure: engrain the changes in order to maintain them.

Announce this plan to the whole organization in order to create a consciousness, understanding, enthusiasm and support.

## CSI Improvement process

It measures and processes the measurements in a continual improvement process that goes **from measuring to improving in seven steps**:

1. *What should you measure?*
2. *What can you measure?*
3. *Gather data*
4. *Process data*
5. *Analyze data*
6. *Present and use the information*
7. *Implement corrective action*

## Service reporting process

Service reporting is the process which is responsible for the generation and supply of reports about the results achieved and the developments in service levels.

# Roles

## Service manager
The **service manager** co-ordinates the development, introduction and evaluation of one or more products or services. He is responsible for:

- achieving company strategy and goals;
- benchmarking;
- financial management;
- customer management;
- vendor management;
- full lifecycle management;
- inventory management.

## CSI manager
The **CSI manager** is responsible for CSI in the organization. He is also responsible for:

- successful introduction of CSI in the whole lifecycle;
- awareness of CSI in the organization;
- allocating CSI roles;
- setting starting points;
- evaluating analyzed data.

The CSI manager must be able to lead projects throughout the organization.

## Service owner

It is crucial to appoint one person responsible for each service: this is the **service owner**. His main responsibilities are:

- owning and representing the service;
- understanding which components make up the service;
- measuring the performance and availability;
- attending *Change Advisory Board* meetings;
- taking part in internal and external service evaluations;
- negotiating about SLAs and OLAs.

## Process owner

The **process owner** ensures that the organization follows a process. He must be a senior manager with enough credibility, influence and authority in the organization departments which are part of the process.

## Other roles

Other roles which are important to CSI:

- **Service knowledge manager**: designs and maintains a knowledge management strategy;
- **Reporting analyst**: evaluates and analyzes data and spot trends;
- **Communication role**: designs a communication strategy for CSI.

# Methods and techniques

There are various method and techniques to check whether planned improvements actually produce measurable improvements. One method or technique is not usually enogh: you need to find the best mix for your organization.

### Implementation review
To determine whether the improvements produce the desired effects.

### Assessments
An **assessment** compares the performance of a process against a performance standard.

### Banchmarks
A **benchmark** is a special type of assessment: organizations compare their processes with the performance of the same types of processes that are commonly recognized as '*best practice*'.

### Balanced Scorecard (BSC)

Kaplan and Norton developed the Balanced Scorecard in the 1990s. Define a Balanced Scorecard for each business unit. Begin carefully: select two to four goals. Then you can extend this as 'waterfall' to the underlying components, such as service desk. Keep measuring regularly.

### Gap Analysis

This analysis aries from assessments and benchmarks. It determines **where the organization is now and the size of the gap where it wants to be**.

### SWOT analysis

A **SWOT analysis** looks at the *Strengths*, *Weaknesses*, *Opportunities* and *Threats* of an organization or project.

### Rummler-Brache swim-lane diagram

Geary Rummler and Alan Brache intoduced the idea of representin the relationships between processes and organizations or departments with '*swim lanes*' in a **Rummler-Brache swim-lane diagram**.

# Tools

CSI needs different types of software to support, test, automate, monitor and report on ITSM processes. Among those tools we can mention:

- Automated incident and probleme solving: pre-programmed scripts that automatically repair the technology and record information for analysis for possible improvements;
- Knowledge management: databeses with descriptions of earlier incidents and problems;
- Performance management: collects data about availability, acapacity and performance;
- Statistical analysis instruments: central collection point for raw data;
- Business intelligence/reporting: collects data from all other tools and generates important information for the business.
