### A YAPP is nothing but a Yo App!
>Wait a second... What's YO???

[Yo](http://www.justyo.co) is a new mobile app that is sweeping tech communities around the world. It is very similar to Facebook Poke with the difference that YO's are used, Pokes are not.


The word YAPP is not an invention of mine (see Raffaele Gaito's [blog post](http://www.raffaelegaito.com/post/95811952422/la-mia-prima-yapp-yo-app-allyoneedis)) but I definitely found that this was a pretty name with which to call these apps.

It is very simple to create apps for YO (YAPP 游때) and today I created *Funny Pics*, a service that allows you to get a random funny picture whenever you want. Just Yo!

The YO username for getting the funniest pics of all times is `FUNNYPICS`. I submitted the app to the YO index (a sort of app store for YO) but I'm still waiting for they to approve and add FUNNYPICS to the index.

I really enjoyed creating this. YO APIs are super simple and it took me just some minutes and a very small amount of lines of code to put all in production 游녨.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var _yoData = {
    "username": "FUNNYPICS",
    "trigger": "you want to see a really funny pic"
  };
  var s = document.createElement("script");
  s.type = "text/javascript";
  s.src = "//yoapp.s3.amazonaws.com/js/yo-button.js";
  (document.head || document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]).appendChild(s);
</script>
