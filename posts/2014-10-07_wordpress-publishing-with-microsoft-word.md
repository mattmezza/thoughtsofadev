## Eureka!

Some days ago I was working at home. I was busy because of a project I had to finish in order to give it to my client. Then, suddenly my telephone started ringing...  

ðŸ˜³->ðŸ˜­->ðŸ˜’

It was one of my customers that was looking for an easy way to share his articles via his WordPress blog. The problem was that he did not (and sure he still does not) know how to edit `html` code into WP TinyMCE textarea in order to create pretty and well designed content. He also added that, normally, he used to write articles with Microsoft Wordâ„¢ and then he used to create PDF. At that point an employee had the responsibility to take such PDF and insert it into WordPress.
_What a tremendous waste of time!_
It took about an hour and an half to think about the problem and to create a solution.

#### EUREKA!ðŸ’¡

I developed an app to rapidly publish a Microsoft Wordâ„¢ page in a WordPress installation. It is a Drag&Drop solution.

All you have to do is:

* Create your Microsoft Wordâ„¢ document
* Export the document into a webpage through Word itself
* Open the application window
* Drag the created `*.html` file into the application window
* Go to WordPress html mode and paste by hitting âŒ˜+V
* Save and publish the article

I hope this could be useful for someone.
I leave the app jar binaries [here](http://mattmezza.github.io/files/Wordx2PressPublisher.jar 'Go to download!') but I'm available to publish the [source code](mailto:mattmezza@gmail.com?subject=Sources+requested+for+WordPress+Publisher) as well.

See you! ðŸ˜œ
