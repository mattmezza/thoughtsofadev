<h1>Organization</h1>
<p>There is not just one way for a company to organize itself. A Service strategy is the implicit blueprint of the design, the size and the scope of an organization.</p>
<p>Organizations characterize themselves by the dominant management style in which the style corresponds with what the organization needs at a specifica moment in time.</p>
<p><em>ITIL</em> describes five recognizable phases in organizational development along the spectrum of centralization and decentralization.</p>
<h2>Phase 1: Network</h2>
<p>In Phase 1, an organization focuses on fast, informal and <em>ad hoc</em> provision of services. The organization is technologically oriented and is uncomfortable with formal structures. For organizations in stage 1 innovation and entrepeneurship are important organizational values. When the demand for sorvice increases, this model is no longer effective.</p>
<p>Advantages of this model are:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid high burocratic costs;</li>
<li>fewer managers are necessary;</li>
<li>the structure is very flexible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages, instead, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>managers must oversee the integration of activities;</li>
<li>significant coordination problems;
opportunities for outsourcing functional activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advice: a change in leadership style is necessary to grow beyond these chalenges.</p>
<h2>Phase 2: Directive</h2>
<p>The Pase 1 crisis can be resolved with a strong management team. Phase 2 focuses on the establishment of hierarchical structures (line management) that differentiate functional activities. Communication is more formal and varioous basic processes are used.</p>
<p>Advice: to grow beyond this challenge, more delegation is necessary.</p>
<h2>Phase 3: Delegation</h2>
<p>A decentralized organizational structure is adopted in which the responsibility shifts from functional ownership (line management) to process ownership. Functional ownership and process ownership do not coincide.</p>
<p>Advice: imporove the co-ordination whithin the organization by initiating formal systems and programs.</p>
<h2>Phase 4: Co-ordination</h2>
<p>In Phase 4 the focus is directed towards the use of formal systems as a means of chieving better co-ordination. Centralization of technical functions and decentralization of service management processes emerge, with the goal of improving response time to market demands.</p>
<p>Advice: if everything is in order internally, the next order of business is to improve co-operation with the customer.</p>
<h2>Phase 5: Collaboration</h2>
<p>During Phase 5 the focus is on the improvemnt with the business. A commonly used structure is the matrix structure with the flow of functional responsibilities (line management) on the vertical line and the flow of product or customer-related responsibilities on the horizontal line.</p>
<p>Advantages of a matrix structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimizes and overcomes functional barriers;</li>
<li>increases speed of response to changing product or customer needs;</li>
<li>opening up communication among functional specialists;</li>
<li>use of the skills of specialists staff who can move from prduct to product and from customer to customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of a matrix structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>lack of a monitoring structure;</li>
<li>conflicting roles can demoralize staff;</li>
<li>possible conflict situation between functions and product or customer needs.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Outsourcing structures</h1>
<p>Can be divided into three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal outsourcing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>Type 1 Internal</em>: provision and delivery of internal stuff, limited in scale;</li>
<li><em>Type 2 Shared Services</em>: working with internal BUs, offers lower costs than Type 1 but still limited in scale;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Traditional outsourcing</strong>: Complete outsourcing of a service, better in terms of scaling but limited in best-in-class capabilities;</li>
<li><strong>Multi-vendor outsourcing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><em>Prime</em>: single contract with one service provider who works with multiple service providers;</li>
<li><em>Consortium</em>: selection of multiple service providers;</li>
<li><em>Selective outsourcing</em>: pool of service providers selected and managed through the service receiver. The most difficult structure to manage;</li>
<li><em>Co-Sourcing</em>: structure of internal or shared services with external providers. The service receiver is also the service integrator.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Roles and responsibilities</h2>
<p>A key role in the implementation of a sourcing strategy lies with the Chief Sourcing Officer, who reports to the CIO and manages the implementation of sourcing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Director of service management</strong>: supervises the provider on behalf of the business;</li>
<li><strong>Contract manager</strong>: manages the service contract;</li>
<li><strong>Product manager</strong>: manages the services in the service provider's organization;</li>
<li><strong>Process owner</strong>: manages the process models that have been developed on behalf of the users;</li>
<li><strong>Business representives</strong>: represent the customers' interests.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Tools for the Service Strategy</h1>
<p>Some helpful tools to better achieve a good service strategy are the <strong>Simulation</strong> and the <strong>Analytical modeling</strong>. The first is a tool to evaluate the consequences of new policies and new structures before they are put into practice. The second is a way to benefit from the knowledge that comes from analytical modeling to improve performance in light of technical, financial and time constraints. Some of these tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Business case</strong>: a way of identifying business objectives that are dependento on service management;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>business case</strong> is a decision-making, support and planning instrument that plans for the likely consequences of a business action.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pre-program ROI</strong>: techniques for quantitatively analyzing investments in service management;
Usage of NPV (Net Present Value) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) to assess the cash flows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You have to <strong>spend money</strong> to <strong>make money</strong>...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><strong>Post-program ROI</strong>: techniques for retroactively analyzing investments in service management.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Quality perspective</h1>
<p>The quality of services, such as that experienced by customers, is based on the <strong>utility</strong> and <strong>warranty</strong> that are provided. The many definitions of quality can be summarized in four broad perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>level of excellence;</li>
<li>price-quality relationship;</li>
<li>conformity to specifications;</li>
<li>meeting or exceeding expectations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Warranty factors</h2>
<p>Some factors are visible and measurable (tangible factors) others are much more difficult to pin down (intangible factors).</p>
<h3>Reliability</h3>
<p>A factory, such as <strong>MTBF</strong> (<em>Mean Time Between Failures</em>), is difficult to calculate. MTBF records the reliability of a service asset: the higher the MTBF, the higher the reliability.</p>
<h3>Maintainability</h3>
<p><em>The Mean Time to Restore Service</em> <strong>MTRS</strong> is the recovery time within which a function (service, or system component) is operational again after a breakdown.</p>

<h3>Redundancy</h3>
<p><em>ITIL</em> defines four redundancy types that can be used individually or in combination: Active and Passive redundancy, and Diverse and Homogeneous redundancy.</p>
<h1>Risks</h1>
<p><em>ITIL</em> defines risk as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Risk</strong> is an uncertain outcome, or in other words, a positive opportunity or a negative threat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The task of tisk management is to ensure that the organization makes use, in a cost-effective manner, of a risk framework that consists of a set of well-defined steps.</p>
<p>There are two phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk analysis</strong>: the gathering of information regarding the exposure to risks;</li>
<li><strong>Risk management</strong>: processes are put in place and these processes are focused on monitoring risks.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Transfer of risks</h4>
<p>Services reduce the risk to the clinet's business but they bring risks to the service providers. Clients compensate the service providers for these risk in a variety of ways: first and foremost by paying for the services.</p>
<p>Some providers must ensure that sufficient compensation occurs but at the same time, they must remain reasonable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Costs are facts but prices are a matter of policy&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means that certain investments can yield a profit over th course of time.</p>
<h4>Risk for the service provider</h4>
<p><em>ITIL</em> recognizes four types of risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contract risks</strong>: risks that the service provider will make it impossible to satisfy the contractual agreements;</li>
<li><strong>Design risks</strong>: there is always a risk that the services will achieve undesidered results, this is a performance risk;</li>
<li><strong>Operational risks</strong>: every organization deals with operational risks, risks for the BUs and risks for the service units;</li>
<li><strong>Market risks</strong>: these risks can be reduced with:
<ul>
<li><em>Differentiation</em>: assets that are scarce and complementary are interesting;</li>
<li><em>Consolidation</em>: reduces the financial risks for service providers as well as the operational risks for the customer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
