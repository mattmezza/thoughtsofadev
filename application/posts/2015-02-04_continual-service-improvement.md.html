<p>I really like to help people to achive their goals with the maximum result. I like to design, develop and maintain large software systems. What makes me really happy is to see people use what I create.</p>

<p>Nowadays IT departments must continually improve their services in order to remain appealing to the business. ITIL version 3 places this within the lifecycle phase of <strong>Continual Service Improvement</strong>.</p>
<p>In English there is a difference between <em>continual</em> and <em>continuous</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>continuous</em> means that the organization is involved in an activity without interruption;</li>
<li><em>continual</em> means a succession of closely placed activities, a sequence of improvement efforts, <em>continual improvements</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>CSI focuses o the activities and processes to improve the quality of services. It uses the <em>Plan-Do-Check-Act</em> Cycle of Deming (PDCA). This cycle prescribes a consolidation phase for each improvement. This is the reason why, in ITIL v3, the 'C' of CSI stands for <em>continual</em> instead of <em>continuous</em>.</p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>CSI mainly measures and monitors the following matters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Process compliance</strong>: Does the organization follow the new service management and does it use the new tools?</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong>: Do the various activities meet their goals?</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: How efficient is the process?</li>
<li><strong>Business value of a process</strong>: Does the process make a difference?</li>
</ul>
<p>The goals of CSI are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to measure and analyze <strong>Service Level Achievement</strong> by comparing with the Service Level Agreements;</li>
<li>to recommend improvements in all phases of the lifecycle;</li>
<li>to introduce activities which will increase the quality, efficiency, effectiveness and customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<h1>CSI and organizational change</h1>
<p>A lot of CSI programs fail because they do not (or cannot) achieve a cultural change of the organization.</p>
<h2>Kotter's 8-steps change model<sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>John P. Kotter, Professor of Leadership at the Harvard Business School, examined over a hundred companies and discovered eight crucial steps needed to successfully change an organization:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a sense of urgency</strong>: identify potential threats and scenarios and examine opportunities, answer the question 'what if we do nothing?';</li>
<li><strong>Form a leading coalition</strong>: identify real leaders and key stakeholders and work on the team;</li>
<li><strong>Create a vision</strong>: determine the values for the change and create a strategy to execute the vision. Provide direction, motivate and formulate goals which are SMART (<em>Specific</em>, <em>Measurable</em>, <em>Achievable/Appropriate</em>, <em>Realistic/Relevant</em> and <em>Timely/Time-bound</em>);</li>
<li><strong>Communicate the vision</strong>: lead by example and address people concerns and anxieties openly and honestly. Each stakeholder must know what the vision is;</li>
<li><strong>Empower others to act on the vision</strong>: remove obstacles, recognize and reward people for making change happen, act proactively to remove barriers;</li>
<li><strong>Plan for and create quick wins</strong>: look for sure-fire projects to implement, motivate the team;</li>
<li><strong>Consolidate improvements and create more change</strong>: do what went wrong/well analysis, set goals and keep ideas fresh but, for first, don't declare victory too early;</li>
<li><strong>Institutionalize the changes</strong>: talk about progresses, be positive and always praise in public and scorn in private.</li>
</ol>
<p>Combined with good project management, these steps will considerably increase the chanches of success.</p>
<h1>The P-D-C-A Cycle</h1>
<p>A big bang approach doesn't usually result in a successful improvement program. That's why Dr. W Edwards Deming developed a ste-by-step improvement model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan</strong>: what needs to happen;</li>
<li><strong>Do</strong>: execute planned activities;</li>
<li><strong>Check</strong>: whether the activities yield the desired result;</li>
<li><strong>Act</strong>: adjust the plan in accordance to the checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next is a consolidation phase to engrain the changes into the organization.</p>

<h1>Metrics, KPIs and CSFs</h1>
<p>A metric measures the results of a process or activity by determining whether a certain variable meets its set target. Three types are needed by CSI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>technology metrics</strong>: measure the performance of components and applications;</li>
<li><strong>process metrics</strong>: measure the performance of service management processes. They stem from <strong>Key Performance Indicators</strong> which, in turn, stem from <strong>Critical Success Factors</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>service metrics</strong>: the results of the end service.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the business mission, <strong>CSFs</strong> are defined: these are elements essential to achieving the mission. The <strong>KPIs</strong> following on from these CSFs determine the quality, performance, value and process compliance. They can either be qualitative (such as customer satisfaction) or quantitative (such as costs of a printer incident).</p>
<p>At the start of th improvement program two or three KPIs per CSF will already supply a great deal of information which will need to be processed.</p>
<h1>Data, information, knowledge and wisdom</h1>
<p>Metrics supply <strong>quantitative data</strong>, CSI transforms this data into <strong>qualitative information</strong>. By combining information with experience, context, interpretation and reflection it becomes <strong>knowledge</strong>. What it comes down to in CSI is <strong>wisdom</strong>: being able to make the correct assessments and the correct decisions by using the data, information and knowledge in the best possible way.</p>

<h1>Governance</h1>
<p>Governance drives organizations and can be distinguished into three types: <strong>Corporate Governance</strong>, <strong>Business Governance</strong> and <strong>IT Governance</strong>. Each of them belong to the <strong>Enterprise Governance</strong>.
<strong>IT Governance</strong> shapes the processes and structure of an IT organization and ensures that it achieves its goals.</p>
<p><img src="/public/content/Governance-CSI.png" alt="" /></p>
<h1>Processes</h1>
<p>The organization must continually assess its current improvement course on relevance, completeness and feasibility. The CSI model can provide some support. This continual cycle consists of six phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>determine the vision: formulates a mission, goals and objectives;</li>
<li>record the current situation: record the starting point;</li>
<li>determine measurable targets: set priorities together with the client;</li>
<li>plan: draw up a detailed service improvement plan;</li>
<li>check: measure whether the objectives have been achieved;</li>
<li>assure: engrain the changes in order to maintain them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Announce this plan to the whole organization in order to create a consciousness, understanding, enthusiasm and support.</p>
<p><img src="/public/content/Continual-Cycle-CSI-1.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>CSI Improvement process</h2>
<p>It measures and processes the measurements in a continual improvement process that goes <strong>from measuring to improving in seven steps</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>What should you measure?</em></li>
<li><em>What can you measure?</em></li>
<li><em>Gather data</em></li>
<li><em>Process data</em></li>
<li><em>Analyze data</em></li>
<li><em>Present and use the information</em></li>
<li><em>Implement corrective action</em></li>
</ol>
<h2>Service reporting process</h2>
<p>Service reporting is the process which is responsible for the generation and supply of reports about the results achieved and the developments in service levels.</p>
<h1>Roles</h1>
<h2>Service manager</h2>
<p>The <strong>service manager</strong> co-ordinates the development, introduction and evaluation of one or more products or services. He is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieving company strategy and goals;</li>
<li>benchmarking;</li>
<li>financial management;</li>
<li>customer management;</li>
<li>vendor management;</li>
<li>full lifecycle management;</li>
<li>inventory management.</li>
</ul>
<h2>CSI manager</h2>
<p>The <strong>CSI manager</strong> is responsible for CSI in the organization. He is also responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>successful introduction of CSI in the whole lifecycle;</li>
<li>awareness of CSI in the organization;</li>
<li>allocating CSI roles;</li>
<li>setting starting points;</li>
<li>evaluating analyzed data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CSI manager must be able to lead projects throughout the organization.</p>
<h2>Service owner</h2>
<p>It is crucial to appoint one person responsible for each service: this is the <strong>service owner</strong>. His main responsibilities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>owning and representing the service;</li>
<li>understanding which components make up the service;</li>
<li>measuring the performance and availability;</li>
<li>attending <em>Change Advisory Board</em> meetings;</li>
<li>taking part in internal and external service evaluations;</li>
<li>negotiating about SLAs and OLAs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process owner</h2>
<p>The <strong>process owner</strong> ensures that the organization follows a process. He must be a senior manager with enough credibility, influence and authority in the organization departments which are part of the process.</p>
<h2>Other roles</h2>
<p>Other roles which are important to CSI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service knowledge manager</strong>: designs and maintains a knowledge management strategy;</li>
<li><strong>Reporting analyst</strong>: evaluates and analyzes data and spot trends;</li>
<li><strong>Communication role</strong>: designs a communication strategy for CSI.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Methods and techniques</h1>
<p>There are various method and techniques to check whether planned improvements actually produce measurable improvements. One method or technique is not usually enogh: you need to find the best mix for your organization.</p>
<h3>Implementation review</h3>
<p>To determine whether the improvements produce the desired effects.</p>
<h3>Assessments</h3>
<p>An <strong>assessment</strong> compares the performance of a process against a performance standard.</p>
<h3>Banchmarks</h3>
<p>A <strong>benchmark</strong> is a special type of assessment: organizations compare their processes with the performance of the same types of processes that are commonly recognized as '<em>best practice</em>'.</p>
<h3>Balanced Scorecard (BSC)</h3>
<p>Kaplan and Norton developed the Balanced Scorecard in the 1990s. Define a Balanced Scorecard for each business unit. Begin carefully: select two to four goals. Then you can extend this as 'waterfall' to the underlying components, such as service desk. Keep measuring regularly.</p>
<h3>Gap Analysis</h3>
<p>This analysis aries from assessments and benchmarks. It determines <strong>where the organization is now and the size of the gap where it wants to be</strong>.</p>
<h3>SWOT analysis</h3>
<p>A <strong>SWOT analysis</strong> looks at the <em>Strengths</em>, <em>Weaknesses</em>, <em>Opportunities</em> and <em>Threats</em> of an organization or project.</p>
<h3>Rummler-Brache swim-lane diagram</h3>
<p>Geary Rummler and Alan Brache intoduced the idea of representin the relationships between processes and organizations or departments with '<em>swim lanes</em>' in a <strong>Rummler-Brache swim-lane diagram</strong>.</p>
<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>CSI needs different types of software to support, test, automate, monitor and report on ITSM processes. Among those tools we can mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated incident and probleme solving: pre-programmed scripts that automatically repair the technology and record information for analysis for possible improvements;</li>
<li>Knowledge management: databeses with descriptions of earlier incidents and problems;</li>
<li>Performance management: collects data about availability, acapacity and performance;</li>
<li>Statistical analysis instruments: central collection point for raw data;</li>
<li>Business intelligence/reporting: collects data from all other tools and generates important information for the business.</li>
</ul>
