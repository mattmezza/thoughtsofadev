<p>Service Design follows Service Strategy in the Service Lifecycle and it refers not only to completely new services but also to modified service delivery.</p>
<p>According to <em>ITIL</em>, the most important objective of Service Design is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The design of new or modified services for introduction into a production environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The objectives of Service Design include:</p>
<ul>
<li>to contribute to the business objectives;</li>
<li>where possible, to contribute to saving time and money;</li>
<li>to minimize or prevent risks;</li>
<li>to contribute to satisfying market needs;</li>
<li>to assess and improve the effectiveness of IT services;</li>
<li>to support the development of policies and standards;</li>
<li>to contribute to the quality of IT services.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some actions that must be undertaken in order to ensure that services that are developed meet the customer's expectations, and these actions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the new service must be added, right from the concept phase, to the Service Portfolio;</li>
<li>the <strong>Service Lever Requirements</strong> (SLR) must be clear before the service is delivered;</li>
<li>the financial management must be involved;</li>
<li>a <strong>Business Impact Analysis</strong> (BIA) and a risk assessment must be performed;</li>
<li>the <strong>service desk</strong> must be brought up to speed regarding the new service delivery before the new services are delivered;</li>
<li>suppliers must be involved if there are purchases to be made.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Design aspects</h1>
<p>There are five aspects on which design focuses on:</p>
<p><img src="/public/content/Design-aspects.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Design of service solutions</h2>
<p>A structured design aproach is necessary in order to produce a new service for the right costs, funcitonality, quality and within the right framework. The process must be <strong>iterative</strong> and <strong>incremental</strong> in order to satisfy customers' changing whishes and requirements.</p>
<p>This approach, <strong>Rapid Application Development</strong> (<em>RAD</em>), is in contrast with the traditional development approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Change is inevitable and discouraging change simply indicates passivity in regard to the market&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Design of the Service Portfolio</h2>
<p>The Service Portfolio is the most critical management system for supporting all of the processes. It describes the service delivery in terms of value for the customer and must include all of the service information and its status. It's important to note that <strong>the customer has an insight only into the Service Catalogue and the other section of the Service Portfolio are not available to the customer.</strong></p>
<p>Although the Service Portfolio is designed during the Service Design phase, the portfolio is managed by the Service Strategy.</p>
<h2>Design of the architecture</h2>
<p><em>ITIL</em> describes the architecture design as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Architecture design</strong> is the development and maintainance of IT policy, strategies, architectures, designs, documents, plans and processes for deployment, implementation and improvements of appropriate IT services and solutions throughout the organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be ensured that:</p>
<ul>
<li>it satisfies the needs of the business;</li>
<li>a proper balance is found among innovation, risks and costs;</li>
<li>it conforms to relevant frameworks, strategies, policies;</li>
<li>there is co-ordination among the designers, planners, stategists, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various framework for the development of enterprise architectures. An enterprise architecture must include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>services architecture</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>application architecture</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>information architecture</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>IT infrastructure architecture</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>environment architecture</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design of processes</h2>
<p>Every process must have a process owner who is responsible for the process and for its improvement.</p>
<p><em>ITIL</em> describe the process as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A <strong>process</strong> is a structured set of activities designed to achieve a specific goal […] <strong>Process control</strong> consists of the planning and regulation of a process, with the purpose of executing that process in an efficient, effective manner.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Design measurement systems and metrics</h2>
<p>In order to lead and manage the development process effectively, regular assessments must be performed. There are four elements that can be investigated, <strong>progress, fulfillment, effectiveness,</strong> and <strong>efficiency</strong> of the process.</p>
<p>Good service design offers the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>lower <strong>Total Cost of Ownership</strong> (<em>TCO</em>);</li>
<li>improved quality;</li>
<li>improved consistency;</li>
<li>simpler implementation;</li>
<li>improved synchronization of service with business needs;</li>
<li>improved effectiveness of performances;</li>
<li>improved IT administration;</li>
<li>more effective service management;</li>
<li>more simplified decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Processes of Service Design</h1>
<h2>Service Catalogue Management</h2>
<p>It comprises the portion of the Service Portfolio that is visible to the customer. At the moment that a service is ready for use, the Service Design produces the specifications that can be included in the Service Portfolio.</p>
<h2>Service Level Management (SLM)</h2>
<p>The goal of this process is to take responsibility for ensuring that levels of IT service delivery are achieved, both for existing services and future services in accordance with the agreed targets. It includes plannin, co-ordinating, providing, agreeing, monitoring and reporting of service level agreements (SLAs).</p>
<h2>Capacity Management</h2>
<p>The goal of capacity management is to ensure that the capacity corresponds to both the existing and future needs of the customer.</p>
<p>Synchronization between capacity management and the Service Portfolio and SLM within the lifecycle of Service Design is essential.</p>
<h2>Availability Management</h2>
<p>The availability and reliability of IT services have a direct influence on customer satisfaction and the reputation of the service provider. Availability management is essential and must be involved at an early stage in the lifecycle. It includes the entire process of designing, implementing, assessing, managing and improving IT services and the components included therein.</p>
<h2>IT Service Continuity Management (ITSCM)</h2>
<p>IT Service Continuity Management plays a valuable role in the support of the process of business continuity planning. Its ultimate goal is to support business continuity by ensuring that the required IT facilities can be restored within the agreed time. The process focuses on occurences that can be considered as disasters.</p>
<h2>Information security management</h2>
<p>Security is not really a step in the lifecycle but Information Security is a continual process and is an integral component of all the services.</p>
<h2>Supplier management</h2>
<p>The goal is to guarantee a constant level of quality for the right price. In order to chieve consistency and effectiveness during the implementation of the policy, a suppliers and contracts database must be established.</p>
<h1>Development of requirements</h1>
<p>There are three types of requirements for each system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>functional requirements</strong>: expressed with use case models;</li>
<li><strong>management and operational requirements</strong>: define the non-functional requirements such as manageability, efficiency, availability and reliability etc…;</li>
<li><strong>usability requirements</strong>: expectations of the users in terms of ease of use and user friendliness.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Organization</h1>
<p>Well performing organizations can quickly and accurately make the right decisions and execute them successfully. It is crucial that the roles and responsibilities are clearly defined.</p>
<h2>The RACI model</h2>
<p>RACI is an acronym for the four most important words:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsible</strong>: the person who is responsible for completing the task;</li>
<li><strong>Accountable</strong>: the <strong>sole</strong> person that is responsible for costs;</li>
<li><strong>Consulted</strong>: people who give advice;</li>
<li><strong>Informed</strong>: people who must be kept in the loop regarding the progress of the project.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>The responsible person must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be aware of the business priorities and objectives;</li>
<li>be aware of the role that IT plays;</li>
<li>possess service skills;</li>
<li>be aware of what IT can provide to the customer;</li>
<li>have the competencies and knowledge that are needed in order to perform the function well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>The most important roles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The process owner</strong>: is reponsible that the process is implemented as agreed and the established objectives will therefore be achieved;</li>
<li><strong>The Service Design manager</strong>: is responsible for co-ordination and inputting of Service Design;</li>
<li><strong>The Service Catalogue manager</strong>: is responsible for the production and maintainance of the Service Catalogue;</li>
<li><strong>The service level manager</strong>: has to ensure that customers' existing and future requirements have been identified, negotiate and make agreements on the delivery of services;</li>
<li><strong>The availability manager</strong>: is responsible for ensuring the existing services are available as agreed, improving proactively the availability of services and assisting in investigating incidents and problems;</li>
<li><strong>The security manager</strong>: has to design and maintain the information security policy, assist in the business impact analysis and perform risk analyses and risk management together with availability management and ITSCM.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<h2>Business Impact Analysis (BIA)</h2>
<p>The Business Impact Analysis is a valuable source of information for establishing the customer's needs and the impact and the risk of a service. It consists of two parts: the investigation of the impact of the loss of a business process or function and the stopping of the effect of that loss.</p>
<p>With the BIA the organization can determine what are the critical services, what is an acceptable time for the service to be unavailable, what are the costs of the loss of the service and other important information.</p>
<h2>Critical Success Factors and KPIs</h2>
<p>It is recommended that every IT service provider focuses on a numbero of Critical Success Factors and KPIs. They should be determined at the beginning of the CSI program.</p>
<p>KPIs for the Service Design process are:</p>
<ul>
<li>% of specifications of the requirements of Service Design produced on time;</li>
<li>% of specifications of the requirements of Service Design produced within budget;</li>
<li>% of Service Transition packets produced on time;</li>
<li>accuracy of Service Design;</li>
<li>accuracy of the SLAs, OLAs and contracts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>There are several risks during the Service Design phase, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the level of maturity in one of the processes is low, it is impossible to reach a high level of maturity in other processes;</li>
<li>business requirements are not clear for the IT personnel;</li>
<li>too little time is allotted for Service Design.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interfaces with other phases in the lifecycle</h2>
<p>The output from every phase is input for the next phase in the lifecycle. Thus Service Strategy provides important input to Service Design, which in turn, provides input to the transition phase. The Service Portfolio represents the backbone of the Service Lifecycle.</p>
