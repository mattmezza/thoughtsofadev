> How to put the output of the Service Design phase into practice...

The **goals** of Service Transition are:

- supporting the change process of the business (client);
- reducing variations in performance and known errors of the new services;
- ensuring that service meets the requirements of service specifications.

The **objectives** are:

- ensuring the minimum impact for services already in production;
- improving customer's satisfaction.

What is Service Transition according to *ITIL*?

More or less:

> A **Service Transition** includes all the processes and activities required to put a process into production and establishes the service specified in the customer and stakeholder requirements.

## Processes of Service Transition

![](/public/content/Service-Transition.png)

### Transition Planning and Support

It is a process that belongs to the *Plan* phase of the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. Its main activities are the elaboration of a **transition strategy**, the preparation of the Service Transition, the **planning** and **co-ordination** and the **support** activity. The main goals are the **planning** and **co-ordination** and the identification, management and **minimization of risks** of service interruption.

### Change Management

This process also belongs to the *Plan* phase of the *PDCA*. Its goal is to make that changes are deployed in a controlled way that means that **changes are evaluated, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented and documented**. It uses stadardized methods and procedures and each change must be included into a Configuration Management Database (*CMDB*). Consideration must be given to the **risks of business**. Its main activities are the **planning** of the change, the release planning, the communication, **recovery** plan, **impact assessments** and continual improvement.

### Service asset and configuration management (SACM)

The goal of this process is to **define service and infrastructure components** and  to maintain accurate configuration records. The main activities are **configuration identification**, status accounting and reporting, verification and audits and, of course, **configuration management**. SACM is also involved in the non-IT assets.

### Realease and deployment management

It is a process belonging to the *Do* phase of the *PDCA* cycle. In fact, the goal of this process is to **build**, **test** and **deploy** the service. Main activity are preparation of building, **testing** and **deployment**, service tests and **pilots** and **Early Life Support**.



### Service validation and testing

This process is a *Check* process. In fact, its goal is to make the service *fit for use* and *fit for purpose* and deliver a service which is of **added value to the customer's business**. Main activities are the **validation and test** management, the **verification** of test plan, **testing** itself and the clean up and closure of the process.

### Evaluation

This process verifies whether or not the performance is acceptable and is an important input for Continual Service Improvement. The goal is to **define performance** of a service change and main activities are: planning the evaluation, **evaluation of predicted performance** and **evaluation of the actual performance**.

### Knowledge Management

This is the last process belonging to Service Transition and its goal is to **improve the quality of decision-making**. This is a process particularly used during Service Transition where there is the need for co-ordination and information (and knowledge) sharing among all participants of the change.

## Risks

Typical risks of the Service Transition phase are the unforeseen expenses that could come during the processes. Other risks come from the lack of knowledge sharing and the bad integration between processes. The de-motivation of the staff may also cause some risks to happen.

### Resistance to changes

Last but not least, another source of potential threats is the resistance that people develop towards changes. This is something that a good manager should not have to underestimate.
Managing organizational changes is not an easy aspect. Essentially, there are two theory that could help managers to act better when involved into similar situations.
The first best practice comes from **Rosabeth Moss Kanter** and her *Ten reasons why people resist change*. In this work Kanter gives a list of 10 motivations that make people be resistant towards a change. She defined these points:

1. **Loss of control**: when changing people could feel like they are loosing control and so manager should invite as much people as he can into planning for the changes in order to make everyone feel like they have control on the change that is happening;
2. **Excess uncertainty**: manager should *create certainty of process*;
3. **Surprise, surprise!**: manager should *sprinkle hints of what's coming* and should not surprise people with an unexpected change;
4. **Everything seems different**: manager should minimize the number of differences introduced;
5. **Loss of face**: manager should clearly state that people were not acting wrong and that *the change is necessary*;
6. **Concerns about competence**: manager should *encourage people* to make them feeling capable of working with the changed system;
7. **More work**: every change includes more work to be accomplished so manager should *allocate people exclusively on the change process* and should *reward and recognize participants*;
8. **Ripple effects**: every change creates ripple effects and manager should *enlarge the stakeholder circle* in order to identify those ripple effects on time and manage the change proactively;
9. **Past resentments**: manager should consider gestures to *heal the past before sailing into the future*;
10. **Sometimes the threat is real**: manager should be *honest, transparent, fast and fair*.

Another scientist, **John P. Kotter** gave an **8-steps Change Model**. Each of these steps tries to give the manager an advice. The steps are:

1. **Create urgency**: identify potential threats and scenarios and examine opportunities;
2. **Form a powerful coalition**: identify real leaders and key stakeholders and work on the team;
3. **Create a vision for change**: determine the values for the change and create a strategy to execute the vision;
4. **Communicate the vision**: lead by example and address people concerns and anxieties openly and honestly;
5. **Remove obstacles**: recognize and reward people for making change happen, act proactively to remove barriers;
6. **Create short-term wins**: look for sure-fire projects to implement, motivate the team;
7. **Build on the change**: do what went wrong/well analysis, set goals and keep ideas fresh but, for first, don't declare victory too early;
8. **Anchor the changes in corporate culture**: talk about progresses, be positive and always praise in public and scorn in private.
