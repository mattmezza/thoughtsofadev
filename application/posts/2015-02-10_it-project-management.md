### Context

Many people and organizations have a new or renewed interest in project management. Mostly it is due to the fact that the number of projects is constantly growing and the complexity of the projects is increasing.

### Project

> "A project is a __temporary endeavor__ undertaken to create a _unique_ product, service or result."

Obviously, an IT project involves the use of hardware, software, and networks. From this definition, projects are **unique**, **temporary** and **developed incrementally**, they **require resources**, have a **sponsor** and **involve uncertainty**.
The triple constraint of project management is regarding the management of **scope**, **time** and **costs**.
A good project manager is crucial to the project success.

### Project Management

It is the application of **knowledge**, **skills**, **tools** and **techniques** to project activities to meet requirements. The people who are involved into a project, by any means or activities, are called _**Stakeholders**_.
There has been defined a framework that tried to standardize Project Management. This framework includes the management of _project stakeholders_, _project management tools and techniques_ and _project management knowledge areas_.
There are 10 project management knowledge areas:

1. Project Integration Management;
2. Project Scope Management;
3. Project Time Management;
4. Project Cost Management;
5. Project Quality Management;
6. Project Human Resource Management;
7. Project Communication Management;
8. Project Risk Management;
9. Project Procurement Management;
10. Project Stakeholder Management.

### Program

> "A program is a **group of related projects** managed in a **coordinated way**."

This coordination is necessary in order to obtain benefits and control that are not available from managing each project separately.

### Project Portfolio Management

It is a process that involves organizing and managing projects and programs as a portfolio of investments that contribute to the entire organization's success. It emphasizes meeting **strategic goals**. Project Management, instead, focuses on meeting **tactical goals**.

### Project Manager

He plays a **key role** in helping projects to succeed. He works closely with other stakeholders and performs various duties. He must possess many skills: from **hard skills** like general management, project management and IT in general to **soft skills** like _leadership_. These skills are necessary to act in the right way when performing the day-to-day job. An experienced project manager, in fact, helps a project to succeed.

### P.M.I.

The **Project Management Institute** is an international professional society that provides certification as a _Project Management Professional_ (_PMP_) and uphold a code of ethics.

Today are available dozens of **project management software tools** that help people by assisting managers in their day-to-day job.

However, being a project manager isn't as simple as it can seem: this is mostly due to the various stakeholders that could interfere with the management of the project.
