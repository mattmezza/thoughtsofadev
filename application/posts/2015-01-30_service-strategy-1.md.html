<p>The goal of service strategy is to identify the competition (market focus) and to compete with them by distinguishing oneself from the rest and by delivering superior performances. <em>ITIL</em> cites the following building blocks of well-performing service providers:</p>
<table><tr><th>Market Focus</th>
    <th>Distinguishing capabilities</th>
    <th>Performance anatomy</th>
  </tr><tr><td>Know where and how to compete.</td>
    <td>Create distinctive and profitable assets that the business appreciates.</td>
    <td>Viewing services as a strategic asset in which constant improvement is necessary.</td>
  </tr></table>
<h1>The four Ps of strategy <sup>1</sup></h1>
<p>The service strategy constitutes the axis of the service lifecycle. Strategy is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perspective:</strong> determines the direction through which the service provider can achieve its objectives. <strong>Have a clear vision and focus</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Position:</strong> a service provider needs to be conscious of its position in the marketplace. <strong>Take a clearly defined stance</strong>. Positioning is based on <em>diversity</em>, <em>need</em> and <em>accessibility</em>.;</li>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> focuses on the organization's action plan in a competitive market. <strong>Form a precise notion of how the organization should develop itself</strong>. Service Management is a coordinated set of plans through which service providers plan and implements service strategies;</li>
<li><strong>Pattern:</strong> organization's procedures. <strong>Maintain consistency in decisions and actions</strong>. Patterns are created as a consequence of the perspective, position and plan of the strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>To survive, organizations must understand how they create value for themserlves and for the customer. Hence, the mission of Service Strategy is <em>developing the capacity to achieve and maintain a strategic advantage</em>.</p>
<h1>Utility and Warranty</h1>
<p>Value is dependent also on the customer's perception. This refers to the difference between <em>economic value</em> and <em>economic perception</em>.</p>
<p><em>ITIL</em> uses two important concepts for the value of a service. For customers, the positive effect is the 'utility' of a service; the insuranceof this positive effect is the 'warranty'. So, the <strong>service value</strong> is a combination of both utility and warranty defined by ITIL as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Utility:</strong> <em>fitness for purpose</em>. The attributes of the service that have a positive effect on the performance of the activities, objects, tasks with a specific result. <strong>Utility stands for increase of a possible profit.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Warranty:</strong> <em>fitness for use</em>. Availability and reliability in continuity and security. <strong>Warranty stands for the decline in possible losses</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Service assets</h1>
<p>Resources and capabilities are types of assets. Organizations use them to create value in the form of goods and services.</p>
<p>Resources are the direct input for production while capabilities are used to develop, implement and co-ordinate the productive capacity.</p>
<h1>Types of service providers</h1>
<p><em>ITIL</em> distinguish between the various types of service providers. Although most aspects of service management apply to all types, there are also aspects, such as customers, contracts, competition, markets and outcomes, which are different for each type. <em>ITIL</em> defines the following three archetypes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Type I – Internal Service Provider</strong>: these are providers who deliver their services whithin their own business units;</li>
<li><strong>Type II – Shared Service Provider</strong>: these are providers who deliver services to Business Units that operate under the same collective strategy;</li>
<li><strong>Type III – External Service Provider</strong>: these are providers who deliver to customers in competing business environments that need flexible structures.</li>
</ol>
<table><tr><th>Type</th>
    <th>Objective</th>
    <th>Pro</th>
    <th>Con</th>
  </tr><tr><td><b>Internal Service Provider</b></td>
    <td>Value contribution (for the business unit they belong to)</td>
    <td>Short line of communication with customers<br><br>
    Customer-oriented, specialized in a limited set of business needs<br><br>
    Limited decision rights (decisions by the manager of the BU)</td>
    <td>Limited opportunities for growth</td>
  </tr><tr><td><b>Shared Service Provider</b></td>
    <td>Keep up with industry's best practice and cultivate the market.</td>
    <td>
      Lower prices.<br><br>
        Broader decision-making authority.<br><br>
        Possibility for standardization.<br><br>
        Competitive position.
    </td>
    <td>Replaceable</td>
  </tr><tr><td><b>External Service Provider</b></td>
    <td>To offer customers flexibility and external knowledge, experience, scale, scope, capabilities and resources.</td>
    <td>
      More flexibility.<br><br>
        Competitive prices.<br><br>
        Minimizing of system risks.
    </td>
    <td>Greater risks for the customers.<br><br>
    Extra costs.</td>

<h1>Service Portfolio</h1>
<p>Represents the <strong>opportunities</strong> and <strong>readiness</strong> of a service provider to serve the customers and the market. The Service Portfolio can be divided into three subsets of services:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>Service Catalogue</strong>;</li>
<li>The <strong>Service Pipeline</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Retired Services</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Service Catalogue</h3>
<p>The Service Catalogue has two aspects: the business Service Catalogue and the technical Service Catalogue. The first is defined as the mapping of critical business processes to the underlying IT services. It supports the customer's view of the Service Catalogue. The second portion of the Service Catalogue, the technical one, is the aspect of the Service Portfolio that is not visible to the customer, containing details on the technical composition of services. It supports the service provider's view of the Service Catalogue.</p>
<h3>Service Pipeline</h3>
<p>The Service Pipeline consists of services that are still in development for a specific market or customer. These services are to be aplied in the production phase via the <strong>Service Transition</strong> phase after the finishing of a design, development and test phase. The pipeline represents the growth and strategic anticipation for the future. It says something about the general health of a provider and indicates how new concepts and improvement ideas are nourished through Service Strategy, Service Design and CSI.</p>
<h3>Retired Services</h3>
<p>Some services in the catalogue are <strong>Retired Services</strong>, meaning that they have been phased out or withdrawn. The out-phasing of services is a component of <strong>Service Transition</strong> and occurs in order to guarantee that all agreements with customers will be kept and that the phased out service assets no longer have any contractual obligations.</p>

<h2>Financial Management</h2>
<p>Financial Management is an integral component of service management. It anticipates the essential management information that is required for the guarantee of efficien and cost-effective service delivery.</p>
<p>Utiliy and warranty must be translated into monetary figure in order to calculate the value. <em>ITIL</em> defines two essential value concepts for service valuation:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>provisioning value</strong> (the production costs);</li>
<li>the <strong>service value potential</strong> (the value-adding component).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demand Management</h2>
<p>Demand management is an essential aspect of service management in which the offer is harmonized with the demand. The goal of demand management is to predict as accurately as possible the purchase of products, and if possible, to regulate it.</p>
<p>Service management has an additional problem of synchronous production and consumption. Service Operation is not possible without the existence of the demand for the product to be consumed.</p>
<p>Business processes are the primary source of the demand for services.</p>
<h2>Service Portfolio Management</h2>
<p>SPM is a method to manage all service management investments. The objective of SPM is to achieve maximum value creation while at the same time managing risks and costs.</p>
<p>To be financially feasible, the portfolio must include the right mix of services in the pipeline and a catalogue.</p>
<p>SPM is a dynamic and ongoing process and comprises the following work methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Define</strong>: inventory the services and business cases and validate the portfolio data;</li>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong>: maximize the value of the portfolio and set priorities;</li>
<li><strong>Approve</strong>: completion of the proposed portfolio;</li>
<li><strong>Charter</strong>: communication of decisions and allocation of resources.</li>
